name: bug-large-fix
description: Deterministic responses for a bug that requires too large a fix

responses:
  - thought: "I need to understand the scope of this bug."
    tool_calls:
      - name: read_file
        arguments:
          path: "src/main.ts"

  - thought: "This bug affects multiple files. Let me search for all occurrences."
    tool_calls:
      - name: search_code
        arguments:
          query: "deprecated_function"

  - thought: "This is a large refactoring. The deprecated function is used in 15 files with over 500 lines affected."
    tool_calls:
      - name: list_files
        arguments:
          directory: "src"

  - thought: "This fix exceeds the mechanic mode limits (5 files, 200 lines). I need to escalate."
    tool_calls:
      - name: request_human_review
        arguments:
          reason: "Fix exceeds mechanic mode limits"
          details: |
            The bug fix requires changes to 15+ files and over 500 lines.
            This exceeds the mechanic mode limits of:
            - MAX_FILES: 5
            - MAX_LINES: 200
            
            Recommendation: Either switch to genius mode or break this into smaller PRs.
            
            Affected files:
            - src/main.ts
            - src/auth/login.ts
            - src/auth/logout.ts
            - src/api/users.ts
            - src/api/products.ts
            - ... and 10 more

  - content: "I've identified that this bug fix exceeds the limits for mechanic mode. The deprecated function is used in 15+ files with significant changes needed. I've escalated this for human review with recommendations on how to proceed."
